Notes:
* Controller is the wxApp derived class. It simply creates the db connection and the game. When the application is exited, it destroys the sqlite connection
* Game controls the progress of the game.
* Board is a glcanvas derived class. When clicked, it notifies Game, and updates the display as appropriate.
* Piece instances are created as necessary
* Moves are logged to the sqlite3 for future analysis
