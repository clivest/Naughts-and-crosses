A simple Naughts and crosses program using wxWidgets and logging to a sqlite database.

Program structure:
              1         1          9
Controller -|-> Game ---|-> Board --> Square -|
            |     |1    |                     |0..1
            |1    V     |              0..9   V
            |->sqlite3  |-----------------> Piece
                                             /\
                                             --
                                             |
                                          --------
                                          |      |
                                          V      V
                                       Naught   Cross

Notes:
* Controller is the wxApp derived class. It simply creates the db connection and the game. When the application is exited, it destroys the sqlite connection
* Game controls the progress of the game.
* Board is a glcanvas derived class. When clicked, it notifies Game, and updates the display as appropriate.
* Piece instances are created as necessary
* Moves are logged to the sqlite3 for future analysis
